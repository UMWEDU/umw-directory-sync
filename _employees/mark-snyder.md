    Mark Snyder is a composer, performer,
    producer, songwriter, video artist and
    teacher living in Fredericksburg
    Virginia. Mark’s multimedia
    compositions have been described as
    “expansive, expressive, extremely
    human, ….Snyder’s compositions
    attract performers who resist to works
    with electronics as well as audiences
    who don’t think they want to hear
    computer processing.” Dr. Snyder is
    Assistant Professor of Music at the
    University of Mary Washington teaching
    courses in electronic music, composition
    and theory. He earned his D.M.A. from
    the University of Memphis, an M.M. from
    Ohio University and a B.A. from Mary
    Washington College. He is a member of
    the American Society of Composers,
