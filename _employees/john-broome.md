    John P. Broome, PhD, is an Assistant Professor and the Program Director of PreK-12, Middle and Secondary Education programs in the College of Education at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on the foundations of teaching and learning, instructional design and assessment, social studies methods, classroom management and educational research.
    
    Dr. Broome is also the UMW Director of the Hungry Brains! at Hazel Hill, a student-run tutoring program for high-poverty elementary and middle school students in downtown Fredericksburg, Virginia. Students in Dr. Broomeâ€™s education classes tutor diverse youth in the program using culturally responsive teaching practices as a service-learning component of their coursework. See the UMW Great Minds at Work article featuring the program.
    
    Dr. Broome's research interests focus on the intersection of civic learning and social justice in teacher education programs and schools in the United States and other countries. He also studies multicultural education, experiential learning, Montessori education, service learning, and online and hybrid teaching models. His work has been presented in locally, nationally and internationally. Recent conferences include the International Montessori Congress of Association Montessori Internationale (AMI), Virginia Council for the Social Studies (VCSS), the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS), the College and University Faculty (CUFA) of the National Council for the Social Studies, and the American Educational Research Association (AERA). Recent publications appear in Social Studies Research and Practice, the Journal of Social Studies Research and The Free-Lance Star.
