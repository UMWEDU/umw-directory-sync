    Dr. Wellington holds her doctorate from
    Harvard University, and she has
    experience teaching courses on all
    levels of French language and
    literature, undergraduate to graduate.
    She is a specialist in the literature of
    the Enlightenment and has concentrated
    her research in the theater and prose
    fiction of that period. In addition to
    her book on the theater of Voltaire, she
    has published articles, both in English
    and French, on various works of prose
    fiction in such journals as Studies on
    Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, The
    Australian Journal of French Studies,
    Dalhousie French Studies, and Romance
    Quarterly. Her current research centers
    on the same area of concentration. She
    is also a regular participant, often by
    invitation, in conferences on
    eighteenth-century studies, she has
    served on the editorial board of four
    professional journals, and she maintains
    membership in numerous professional
    organizations.
