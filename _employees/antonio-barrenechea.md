  - 'Antonio Barrenechea, Associate Professor of English, earned a Ph.D. (2005) and M.Phil. (2001) from Yale University, after receiving a B.A. (1998) from Fordham University. All of his degrees are in Comparative Literature. Dr. Barrenechea is an expert on Literature of the Americas, and in Cinema Studies. He is the author of America Unbound: Encyclopedic Literature and Hemispheric Studies (University of New Mexico Press, forthcoming), a study of the imagination of history in big novels from Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. His most recent publications include an article that contributes to the decennial “state of the discipline” report of the American Comparative Literature Association, and a career retrospective essay on Thomas Pynchon for American Book Review (forthcoming). He will be on leave in 2016-17 to complete part of a project on the inter-American dimensions of exploitation cinemas. He presently serves on the advisory boards of the Comparative American Literature Association, the International American Studies Association, the International Association for Inter-American Studies, and Comparative American Studies: An International Journal.'
