  - |
    One of the most successful men’s tennis coaches in the nation, Todd Helbling has brought the University of Mary Washington program to an elite position among NCAA Division III tennis. Helbling has led the Eagles to the NCAA Tournament in each of his 16 seasons, including in in 2008, when the Eagles tied a school record with 22 wins en route to a 22-7 overall mark. UMW won 21 matches in 2006, and 22 in 2007, and 21 in 2014 and again in 2015, the winningest stretch in school history. 
    
    A strong player in his own right, Helbling is a 1989 graduate of Millsaps College in Jackson, MS, where he was nationally ranked in both his junior and senior seasons. After earning team captain and MVP honors at Millsaps, Helbling received his master’s degree in sport management from the University of Massachusetts in 1990. He was then hired as assistant men’s and women’s tennis coach and head men’s soccer coach at Washington (MD) College, where in his six years, the Sho’men men’s team captured two NCAA Division III National Championships (1994 and 1997). Helbling then moved on to Slippery Rock University, where he led the women to their best-ever record of 13-6. 
    
    He was hired in the spring of 1999 at Mary Washington, and has left an indelible mark on the history of the program, long known as one of the best of UMW’s 22-sport contingent. When asked of the possibilities at UMW, Helbling is naturally optimistic. "There is an opportunity here to be one of the top programs in the nation, given the school’s academic excellence, the beautiful campus, and the opportunity to play year-round at a first-class facility."
    
    Todd and his wife Kelli are the parents of seven children and live in Spotsylvania.
