    Deborah A. O’Dell, Associate Professor of Biology, earned a Ph.D. (1985) in cell and developmental biology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook after receiving a B.S. (1979) in biology from Ursinus College (Pennsylvania).
    
    A member of the Society for Neuroscience, Dr. O’Dell is an expert on the structure and function of the nervous system, magnetic orientation in animals, and developmental neurobiology. Much of her research focuses on the function and development of nervous systems, including bees, and the role of inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease. 
    
    Dr. O’Dell’s recent interview about her research into how bees use magnetic fields to orientate themselves aired on the “With Good Reason” public radio program. In the interview, she discussed her interest in recent studies suggesting that bees living near cell phone towers may become disoriented and produce less honey.
