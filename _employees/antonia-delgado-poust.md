    Antonia Delgado-Poust earned a Ph.D. in Spanish Literature from Pennsylvania State University in 2011. Professor Delgado-Poust specializes in contemporary Peninsular studies, with a theoretical focus on film, narrative, and culture, Gender, Feminist, Memory, and Cultural Studies. In recent publications, Professor Delgado-Poust considers female/feminist/maternal memory and identity, gender violence, bodily and existential transformation, horizontal female oppression, and the figure of the female detective. Professor Delgado-Poust currently is working on a book manuscript on the intersections of feminism, female ontological insecurity, and (faulty) memory in contemporary Spanish narrative.
