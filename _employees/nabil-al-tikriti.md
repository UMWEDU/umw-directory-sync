    Nabil Al-Tikriti, Associate Professor of History, earned a Ph.D. (2004) in Ottoman history from the University of Chicago, an MIA (1990) from Columbia University, and a BSFS (1988) in Arab studies from Georgetown University. He also studied at the Center for Arabic Studies Abroad’s advanced Arabic language immersion program at The American University in Cairo, and the advanced Turkish language immersion program at Bogaziçi University in Istanbul. In 2011 he was elected to serve a 3 year term as a member of the Board of Directors for MSF/Doctors Without Borders USA.
    From 1992 to 2003, Dr. Al-Tikriti was a context and liaison officer, administrator, and logistician for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF-Doctors Without Borders), an international humanitarian aid organization that provides emergency medical assistance to populations in danger in more than 70 countries. He worked in Jordan, Turkey, Albania, Iran, Syria and Somalia, and his duties included jointly conducting an exploratory mission determining potential Médecins Sans Frontières activity in Iraq; negotiating with community and clan leaders concerning team security and staff contracts; serving as liaison with United Nations, nongovernmental organizations, and local government personnel; and controlling personnel issues for more than 200 local staff in a war zone. In 2011, he was elected to serve a three-year term as a member of the MSF-USA Board of Directors, and in 2013 he served as Deputy Head of Mission for an MSF team operating in Syria.
    Dr. Al-Tikriti also has served as a polling station supervisor and election monitor for nine elections since 1997 in Bosnia, Kosovo, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and Albania for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In conjunction with his interest in peace and conflict, Dr. Al-Tikriti researched the effects on Iraqi civil society of the 2003 Anglo-American invasion after being awarded a 2007-2008 Jennings Randolph Fellowship at the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington D.C.
    Dr. Al-Tikriti’s publications on early modern Ottoman intellectual history, contemporary Iraqi cultural patrimony, higher education and forced migration have appeared in a number of journals, edited volumes, and web reports. He has received several grants and scholarships, including a 2000 Fulbright Fellowship and a 2011 National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)/American Research Institute in Turkey (ARIT) grant.
    He has delivered conference lectures and presentations throughout the United States and in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, Iraq, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Japan. In 2011, he served as external discussant and delivered the keynote address, “The State of the Middle East Studies in the American Academy,” for the 5th Joint International Workshop in Tokyo, organized by Kyoto University and the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. In 2012-13 he offered lectures on Ottoman History, translation, and contemporary Iraq in Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt.
    Dr. Al-Tikriti is a member of the American Historical Association, the Middle East Studies Association and the MSF/Doctors Without Borders U.S. Association.
