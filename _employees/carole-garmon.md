    Carole Garmon, Professor of Art and Department Chair, holds an MFA (1996) and a BFA (1993) in sculpture from Virginia Commonwealth University. She is a recipient of UMW’s Outstanding Young Faculty Member Award and several Faculty Development Grants. Garmon’s research acknowledgments include the accessioning of select images and research materials on Rembrandt into the Rijks Museum Library in Amsterdam, Holland, and participating in a BBC 2 documentary on Rembrandt’s painting The Night Watch. The segment is part of the larger series, The Private Life of the Masterpiece.
    She was one of two Americans chosen to participate in the international exhibition Inspired By Rembrandt commemorating Rembrandt’s 400th birthday. In addition to numerous private collections, her work has been exhibited at the Main Art Gallery and 1708 Gallery in Richmond, the WPA/Corcoran Museum in Washington, D.C., the Arlington Arts Center, as well as Lima, Peru and Berlin, Germany.
    Garmon is a member of the College Art Association, the American Association of University Professors, the National Council of Art Administrators, and the International Council of Fine Art Deans. She has curated numerous exhibitions including State of the Arts, a mid-Atlantic exhibition where she served as curator for the state of Virginia.
    She specializes in all technical aspects of sculpture, including woodworking, metal work, welding, casting, foundry work, mold-making, and faux techniques. A faculty member at UMW since 1998, she also teaches classes on extended media (video and performance art), art theory and criticism, and contemporary issues in art.
