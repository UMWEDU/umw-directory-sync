    Keith E. Mellinger, Professor of Mathematics and Director of the Quality Enhancement Plan, earned a Ph.D. (2001) and M.S. (1997) in mathematics from the University of Delaware, after receiving a B.S. (1995) in mathematics from Millersville University (Pennsylvania). He also had a VIGRE (Vertical Integration of Research and Education) post-doctoral position at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
    
    The recipient of many internal grants and a Jepson Fellowship from the University of Mary Washington, Dr. Mellinger is a Project NExT fellow through the Mathematical Association of America.  In 2006, he was awarded a young investigator grant from the National Security Agency for his research in finite geometry and coding theory.  In 2008, Mellinger was recognized with the UMW Alumni Association Outstanding Young Faculty Member Award, and in 2010, he and a Virginia Tech colleague received the Carl B. Allendoerfer Award at the Mathematical Association of America annual meeting.  This national writing award honored Dr. Mellinger for the article “Kirkman’s Schoolgirls Wearing Hats and Walking Through Fields of Numbers.”  In 2013, the Millersville University Alumni Association honored Dr. Mellinger with their Young Alumni Achievement Award.
    
    Dr. Mellinger has delivered professional presentations throughout the country and in England, Greece, Italy, and Canada. Most recently, he spoke on “Minimal Kakeya Sets” at the 24th British Combinatorial Conference in London, and he delivered a presentation linking mathematics and music at a regional meeting of the Mathematical Association of America held at Salisbury University. He has published many articles on both mathematical research and pedagogy in a variety of professional journals. Recent publications include the papers “Blocking semiovals containing conics” published in Advances in Geometry (2013), “Generalized Pellegrino caps” in Finite Fields and Their Applications (2012), “Spreads, Arcs, and Multiple Wavelength Codes” in Discrete Mathematics (2011), and “2-dimensional optical orthogonal codes from Singer groups” in Discrete Applied Mathematics (2009). In addition, an article he recently co-authored with a UMW undergraduate student titled “Minimal Kakeya sets” will appear in the Journal of Combinatorial Designs.
    
    Dr. Mellinger has served as referee for several research journals and is a brief/script reviewer and mathematical content consultant for the PBS show CyperChase. He is a member of the American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of America, and the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications.
