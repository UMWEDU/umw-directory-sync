    Mara Scanlon, Professor of English, received her Ph.D. and M.A. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a B.A. from the University of Virginia. Her teaching and research interests include poetry and poetics, Modernism, women’s literature, literature of the Great War, ethics and literature, Asian American literature, and digital humanities.
    
    Dr. Scanlon co-edited and authored the introduction for the essay collection Poetry and Dialogism: Hearing Over (2014). Other articles have been published in College Literature; Approaches to Teaching H.D.’s Poetry and Prose; LIT: Literature, Interpretation, Theory; The Bucknell Review; World Literature Today; The Virginia Review of Asian Studies; Asian American Novelists; and The Writer’s Chronicle. Her professional work includes a collaborative, multi-university National Endowment for the Humanities Grant awarded for a project in the digital humanities called “Looking for Whitman: the Poetry of Place in Life and Work of Walt Whitman.” In an interview that aired on the <a href="http://withgoodreasonradio.org/">"With Good Reason"</a> public radio program, Dr. Scanlon and Dr. Brady Earnhart discussed how poet Walt Whitman helped heal wounded Civil War soldiers in Fredericksburg in the same way he hoped his poetry could heal the war-torn nation.
    
    Dr. Scanlon’s current projects include an essay on Walt Whitman and literary tourism in the digital age (forthcoming); an article on Rebecca West’s World War I novel The Return of the Soldier; and research in the field of modernist periodical studies and "the poetess."
    
    Dr. Scanlon is a member of Phi Beta Kappa and winner of UMW’s 2014 Grellet C. Simpson Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.
