    Jack Bales, Reference and Humanities Librarian, earned an M.A. (1974) in library science from the University of Illinois and a B.A. (1973) in English from Illinois College. Although a librarian by vocation, he is a writer by avocation and has published numerous works for books, journals, magazines, and newspapers. His books include literary studies on American authors Horatio Alger, Jr., Kenneth Roberts (Northwest Passage), Esther Forbes (Johnny Tremain), and southern author Willie Morris (best known for the award-winning North Toward Home and the memoir My Dog Skip, which was made into a popular motion picture). A member of the Society for American Baseball Research, he has written articles on the Chicago Cubs for the Baseball Research Journal and Nine: A Journal of Baseball History and Culture. 
    Bales particularly enjoys sharing his knowledge of research techniques with students. Working closely with the various UMW disciplines in the humanities, he provides not only one-on-one assistance to students needing term paper help but also class instruction.
