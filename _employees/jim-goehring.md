He received an M.A. (1976) in religious studies from the University of California at Santa Barbara and a B.A. (1972) in social science from the University of California at Berkeley. An expert in late antique and early Christian studies, Dr. Goehring has memberships in professional societies that include the International Association for Coptic Studies, the Society of Biblical Literature, and the North American Patristics Society, of which he served as president in 2004-05.
