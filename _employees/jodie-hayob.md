    Jodie L. Hayob, Professor of Geology, earned a Ph.D. (1994) and an M.S. (1989) in geology from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, after having earned a B.S. (1987) in geology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. With expertise in petrology, mineralogy and geochemistry, she has had her work published in various journals including American Mineralogist, Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology, and Nature. Dr. Hayob also has given numerous presentations at international meetings of the American Geophysical Union and the Geological Society of America. Among her honors are Undergraduate Research Awards at the University of Mary Washington, a Faculty Development Grant at UMW, a Geological Society of America Research Grant and a National Science Foundation Fellowship.
    
    Dr. Hayob is currently a collaborator on a National Science Foundation STEP grant (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program) of more than $444,000 aimed at increasing the number and diversity of STEM graduates at UMW. Dr. Hayob also was one of several principal investigators who was awarded a National Science Foundation grant of $247,241 to acquire a variable-pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive system at Mary Washington. The SEM, installed during the spring of 2005, is used for research and courses in several disciplines including geology, biology, physics and chemistry.
    
    She was invited to serve as associate editor of the metamorphic rocks and petrography working group for a Science Education Resource workshop titled “Teaching Mineralogy, Petrology and Geochemistry in the 21st Century” sponsored by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers. She was associate chair of the Geology Development Team: Virginia Urban Corridor Teacher Preparation Collaborative, and is a member of the Geological Society of America and Phi Beta Kappa.
