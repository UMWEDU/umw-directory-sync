    Jon McMillan is an artist and educator
    currently residing in Fredericksburg,
    Virginia, where he is an Assistant
    Professor of Ceramics at the University
    of Mary Washington. He holds an MFA from
    Southern Illinois University at
    Edwardsville, and a BFA from James
    Madison University, where he also earned
    a minor in Art History. After
    undergraduate school, Jon worked for
    seven years as a full time functional
    potter while freelancing as a
    professional cook. Currently, he makes
    functional and sculptural ceramic
    artwork, both of which are exhibited
    widely. This past year, Jon taught
    ceramics workshops in Houston, Texas,
    and Vallauris, France, where he also
    undertook a month long artist residency.
    When he is not in the studio, he enjoys
    playing musical instruments and spending
    time outdoors, either boating or hiking.
