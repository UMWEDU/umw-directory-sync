    My research focuses on the importance of dialogic teaching in the classroom. My theoretical and methodological framework stems from Bakhtin/Volosinov theory of the utterance to investigate how literacy teachers interpret and implement the literacy curriculum across the content areas to scaffold studentsâ€™learning. A further development of my research is the investigation of how multimodal literacy is changing the approach to literacy instruction across the curriculum. I am currently writing an invited chapter on classroom culture in a book for ESL students edited by Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the Intensive English Center at St. Cloud University, Minnesota.
    I am also developing in collaboration with the literacy faculty a graduate literacy practicum overseas. The goal and objective of the overseas practicum is to give students the opportunity to experience education from an international and global perspective. The philosophical principles of the program stem from my research precepts on literacy as the core component in teaching and learning to give students the opportunity to acquire a global and complex perspective of the literate world in the 21st century.
