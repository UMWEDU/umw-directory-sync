    Mark joined the UMW Business
    Administration faculty in 1997 after a
    27-year career in the public and private
    sectors as well as the academy and in
    1998, was appointed as the Associate
    Dean in the Center for Graduate and
    Professional Studies (which was named
    the James Monroe Center for Graduate and
    Professional Studies when the Stafford
    Campus opened, which became the College
    of Graduate and Professional Studies
    when Mary Washington College became the
    University of Mary Washington and is now
    the UMW Stafford Campus). He has served
    the university in a variety of ways –
    as a visiting Business Administration
    faculty member, being a part of the team
    that opened the Stafford Campus, taking
    a leadership role in the development of
    the university’s third campus in
    Dahlgren and now serving as the
    Executive Director of the UMW Campuses
    at Stafford and Dahlgren. Interestingly,
    he is the only UMW faculty or staff
    member who has worked on all three
    campuses. Mark has extensive public
    sector leadership development experience
    and has specialized in designing and
    delivering assessment-based professional
    development programs and consulting
    services for state and federal
    government executives and managers. Mark
    holds an a Ph.D., (Vanderbilt
    University, Peabody College, 1977), MBA
    (UMW, 2006), and an M.Ed. and a B.Ed.
    (University of Miami, 1972 and 1970).
    Mark and his wife Sharon live in North
    Stafford, have three successful adult
    children – ages 32, 37 and 40 – and
    two wonderfully adorable granddaughters,
    Ella (age 6½) and Emily (age 3½).
    Their leisure time pursuits include
    spending vacations at the ocean,
    reading, home maintenance and yard work,
    supporting their church worship team
    (Mark on drums and Sharon in the
    sound/projection booth – really!), and
    enjoying the company of their two
    90-pound Golden Retrievers, Preston and
    Cooper.
