wpcf-biography:
  - 'Dr. Di Lauro received her B.A. in French, German, and Comparative Literature from the University of Pennsylvania and her M.A., M.Phil., and Ph.D. in French Literature from Yale University. Her dissertation, Les mortz qu’en moy tu renovelles: Eros and Thanatos in Maurice Scève’s Délie, focuses on metaphors of death in the first lyrical cycle and the first Petrarch-inspired love poetry ever published in France, making her officially a specialist in early modern poetry. Dr. Di Lauro’s interests outside the Renaissance include nineteenth-century French literature as well as comparative approaches to literature–especially the interface between literature and the visual arts and the connection between French and German Romanticism. Publications include articles in Emblematica: An Interdisciplinary Journal for Emblem Studies and The National Central University Journal of Humanities, as well as in the special edited volumes entitled Spaces of Consumption and Disposable Culture: A Material Dialogue in Medieval Europe and Euro Pop!: Essays on European Popular Culture.'
