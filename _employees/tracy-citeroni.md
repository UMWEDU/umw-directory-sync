wpcf-biography:
  - 'Tracy B. Citeroni, Associate Professor of Sociology, earned a Ph.D. (1998) in sociology from the University of Texas at Austin, after receiving an M.A. (1992) in sociology from the University of Pittsburgh and a B.A. (1990) in sociology from St. Vincent College in Pennsylvania.  Critical investigation of social inequalities and a deep and abiding concern for social justice inform her research and teaching. More recently, this has translated into a commitment to public sociology and community-level research that involves students and local stakeholders in the design and execution of projects intended to help people confront relevant social problems. She is a member of the American Sociological Association, Sociologists for Women in Society, Sociologists Without Borders, and the Southern Sociological Society.'
