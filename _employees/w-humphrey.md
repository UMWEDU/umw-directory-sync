wpcf-biography:
  - >
    I am the Blue Collar Professor. For most
    of the year, you can expect to see dirt
    under my fingernails. One of my favorite
    smells is burning biomass. The Ohio
    River runs through my veins. And, no
    matter how far I travel, the hills of
    Kentucky are never too far away. I have
    a knack for mobilizing global grassroots
    movements on a shoe-string budget. My
    pedagogy was forged on the gridiron.
    Three bullies and a bathroom determined
    the path of social justice I walk today.
    And, the best compliment I ever received
    was from a student who told me that I
    was “10 pounds of cool in a 5 pound
    bag.” I am a Tribal Teacher committed
    to rewilding my students. I am the
    founder of the Two Dollar Challenge,
    Month of Microfinance, Poverty Action
    Conference, and La Ceiba Microfinance.
    And, I am a blogger who explores the
    Do’s and Don’ts of Doing Good and
    gives half-time speeches to those
    looking to make a dent in the world.
