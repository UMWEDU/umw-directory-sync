wpcf-biography:
  - >
    After 28 years of classroom experience I
    have moved into Teacher Preparation to
    work with the next generation of
    educators. Currently classrooms are
    quite diverse and educators need a set
    of skills to meet these challenges. As
    we move to a more global society these
    skills will be imperative.
