    Liane R. Houghtalin, Professor of Classics, earned a Ph.D. (1993) and an M.A. in classical archaeology from Bryn Mawr College, after receiving an A.B. in classical archaeology and Latin from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Dr. Houghtalin currently is involved in several archaeological projects in Tunisia and Greece. She has brought back more than 6,000 coins from various excavations in ancient Carthage (Tunisia) for cleaning and study at Mary Washington.
    
    Dr. Houghtalin has given numerous presentations dealing with classical archaeology and numismatics both at national professional conferences and to statewide and community organizations. She has a special interest in the influence of the classical world on the modern world, and this has led her to organize a semester-long public lecture series on slavery and a symposium on the biographical tradition of Mary Washington.
    
    Dr. Houghtalin also has made contributions to many books, including Underwater Investigations at Roman Minturnae and most recently to Bir Ftouha: A Pilgrimage Church Complex at Carthage. The recipient of various fellowships for research and study, Dr. Houghtalin is a member of several professional organizations including the American Numismatic Society, the Archaeological Institute of America, and the American Philological Association.
