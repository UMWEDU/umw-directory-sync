    Christopher Kilmartin, Professor of Psychology, received a Ph.D. (1988) and M.S. (1986) in counseling psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University, after earning a B.S. (1976) in psychology from Frostburg State College. Dr. Kilmartin is a licensed clinical psychologist who has a great deal of experience consulting with businesses, college students, human service workers, and counselors.
    
    His major scholarly work is The Masculine Self (fourth edition, Sloan Publishing, 2010), which also is being translated in Korea. Dr. Kilmartin published the chapter “Incremental terrorism: Cultural masculinity, conflict and violence against women” in the book Cultural Dimensions of Conflicts. He also co-authored Men’s Violence Against Women: Theory, Research, and Activism (with Julie Allison, Erlbaum, 2007), The Pain Behind the Mask: Overcoming Masculine Depression (with John Lynch, 1999; translated into Hebrew, 2004; Korean edition pending) and Sexual Assault in Context: Teaching College Men about Gender (with Alan Berkowitz, Erlbaum, 2005), a manual based on his consultation experiences. Recent presentations include “A Model of Gender-Based Violence: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Prevention” at the National Summit on Interpersonal Violence and Abuse Across the Lifespan, “Preventing Sexual Assault and Harassment in a Military Setting: Lessons Learned” at the American Men’s Studies Association meeting, “Using Humor and Drama in Men’s Work” at the National Psychotherapy with Men meeting, and “Sexual Assault: The perpetrator, the Victim and the Social Context” at a continuing education workshop.
    
    Dr. Kilmartin wrote “Violence Is a Men’s issue” in The Good Men Project magazine (2010) and “Let’s not wink at ‘rape lite’ – or blame the victim” in The Free Lance-Star (2010).
    
    Drawing on his background as a professional stand-up comedian, he wrote a solo theatre performance on men’s issues, Crimes Against Nature. An integration of his scholarly and performing interests, and performed by the author, the work debuted in March 1998 and toured to more than 200 campuses and other venues before Dr. Kilmartin retired the performance in 2004. He is currently touring with a lecture/storytelling hybrid titled Guy Fi: The Fictions that Rule Men’s Lives.
    
    Dr. Kilmartin is an internationally recognized expert on gender and on violence prevention. He recently concluded a three-year consultation with the U.S. Naval Academy on a revision of sexual assault and harassment prevention curriculum. He was a scriptwriter for a U.S. Army training film on the same topic and has also presented at the Army Summits on Sexual Assault. He participated as a consultant in the U.S. Department of Education’s 2001 Meeting on Violence Prevention in Higher Education.
    
    Dr. Kilmartin was named a divisional Researcher of the Year at the 2010 conference of the American Psychological Association. The award was given by the Society for the Psychological Study of Men and Masculinity, Division 51. In 2007 he was named the Fulbright Distinguished Chair in Gender Studies at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria, one of only 39 such honors awarded annually worldwide. He was elected to Fellow Status in the American Psychological Association in 2008 and is past president of the APA’s Society for the Psychological Study of Men and Masculinity, Division 51. In addition, he recently delivered the keynote address at the NCAA’s first violence prevention summit held in Indianapolis.
