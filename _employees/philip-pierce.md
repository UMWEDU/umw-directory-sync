    Philip arrived at UMW in July of 2013 and has overseen daily operations of the Athletic Department’s fundraising initiatives while managing the Eagle Club and Corporate Partner Program. Philip works closely with University Advancement and Alumni Relations to provide and strengthen engagement opportunities with alumni, community members, parents and UMW athletic programs. In May 2014, Philip spearheaded the First Annual Athletics Gala, a sold-out event that nearly generated $50,000 in net revenue.
    
    When he isn’t recruiting new Eagle Club members Philip is charged with marketing and promoting all UMW Athletic teams, contests and special events. In his first few months as an Eagle, Philip organized Eagle Nation Day, a free community festival at the Battleground Athletic Complex designed to connect UMW student-athletes with local families and children. While building the “Eagle Nation” brand, Philip has helped elevate UMW’s profile with over 450 Eagle Club members in the athletic foundation’s first year.
    
    Starting in 2013, Philip will serve as the new Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) Advisor. Through SAAC, Philip annually leads 40 student-athlete team representatives in promoting a positive student-athlete image on campus, community engagement initiatives and generating a student-athlete voice within department administrative issues and policy.
    
    Philip graduated from James Madison University with a degree in Sport and Recreation Management in 2009 and returned home to Fredericksburg where he became Assistant Manager at the Fredericksburg Field House indoor/outdoor artificial turf facility. In 2011, Philip returned to JMU to earn a master’s degree in Sport and Recreation Leadership while serving as a Men’s Soccer assistant coach under Tom “Doc” Martin who is first in career wins among active NCAA Division I coaches. During the 2011 season JMU Men’s Soccer reached the NCAA Tournament’s Round of 16 and the following year the team beat defending national champions and #1 ranked UNC.
    
    Philip enjoys surfing, soccer, and golf, and is passionate for all Boston and DC sport teams. He and his wife Kerrie were married in June 2015.
